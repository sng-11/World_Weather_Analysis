# World Weather Analysis

## Overview of Project
The app, PlanMyTrip, allows users to plan out cities to visit depending on their desired temperature range. Using Pandas and several APIs (Google and Weather App), weather data is pooled of cities around the world and input statments are used to filter based on current weather. From the list of potential travel destinations, nearby hotels are identified. Finally, four cities were chosen and the Google Maps Directions API is used to map out how to travel between the four by driving. The route is displayed through a Google marker layer map.
